This will happen. Someone will be given a new task, or will need to be transitioned, or put on a new project, whatever. Maybe you've got co-op students or interns. Maybe you found someone whose attitude will more than make up for lack of technical skills.

Pair the Jr Jr developer with another Jr or intermediate developer. This is good because:
- the Jr Jr will learn more (more on this later)
- it's a better use of resources (they get paid less, right) which is a consequence of what I'll discuss
- it's potentially a terrific opportunity for the Jr-Int to hone their skills by teaching someone else and I don't know, just be better and have some fun with it

Adopt an attitude of patience. If you're in charge of this person, for the next week or two, you won't be productive. Your job is to make the _other_ person productive as fast as possible. Good attitudes to adopt:

- firmness! don't say "well, this would be better", say "this will perform better, this is shorter code, this is best practices"
- attentiveness: watch their face, watch their code. Seek fundamental misunderstandings and misconceptions
- empathy: remember when YOU were a newb (this is why I advocates newbies training newbies)
- information trickling: don't front-load knowledge if possible

Setting up the environment. This is _such_ a horrifying order for most people, because it requires sprawling knowledge. If they're completely green, set up the environment for them. Give high-level detail, so they know at least what to Google and which part is responsible for what.

Destroying the magic. Removing things are "it automagically" and explaining low-level things.

Finding them a semi-beginning to work with. In my case, that's me.

Gradually rolling code-reviews, with deep documentation. This one can have specifics, with three phases. One: guided code and hand-holding. Two: code review with provided suggestions. Three: code review with no code suggestion.

Mandatory reading material. Fuckign _mandatory_, guys. Your job is to know these things if you're a domain master. Recommend the best of the best.

Trickling supplementary information when there is context.

Watching for frustration. This is not always possible, but if you can _spot_ frustration, it means they've been at something for a long time. I tell people to bug me if something's taking them more than 15 minutes. If they're smashing keyboards, they didn't ask.
