A week after I installed 1Password I no longer knew any of my passwords, which was a bizarre thing to say out loud. I was released from coming up with passwords, and from remembering them. My passwords were all secure and all different, which is a big win for security. Now that it’s been a few years I am going to do the same thing for my usernames.

I don’t want to re-use passwords to avoid getting hacked. I don’t want to re-use usernames to avoid getting tracked. I think what I really want is to have a different username everywhere, and now I can do it.

A consistent identity (username and avatar) is prescribed to most professionals on the internet. This makes it easy for someone to discover a person. This is my work, these are my photos, these are my funny jokes. I am fine to opt out of this. These are my writings. Who I am is not particularly important—if it was important, I could always let you know personally.

This might seem shady, but privacy is privacy! A determined bad actor will probably be able to piece it all together, and that’s okay. I just don’t want anyone and everyone to track down all of my existence all at once whenever they want without even trying. I don’t want ad services to do this, I don’t want my employers to do this, and I don’t want any internet randoms to do this. Not without doing some homework, anyway.

I don’t have much to hide, but I’m hiding it anyway.
