## Basics

Well,

I'm a web developer in Toronto, Canada. I have a degree in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo. I work for a great little company. I'm not too sure why I have this website, but I enjoy it.

## Quirks

I’m tidy and precise in all things. I value pragmatism, clarity, and personality. I respect discipline, honesty, and curiosity. I’m _really_ tall and unfortunately pretty loud. I never stress out and I always do my homework. I prefer tea to coffee and cider to beer. Sometimes I have strong opinions, but the more I learn the weaker they get. I'm unlearning being snarky. I write _many_ lists.

## Filling The Hours

I listen to a ton of music, I watch and re-watch movies, I like good TV and I do a bad job of reading enough books. I write, and hate every word of it. I play pool pretty well, I climb often, and I'm a mediocre cook but I'm learning.

## Paying The Bills

Over the years I've written REST APIs, data viz dashboards, metrics collection systems, machine learning projects, eCommerce websites. I've done QA and helped train new employees. I've assembled chairs and shelves. I've set up cloud servers, written SQL queries, set up MongoDB clusters. I've done UI work and it was hard. I've worked with Nginx, Flask, d3, Postgres, AWS, Snap.svg, Django, Foundation, Ractive.js, Angular, Node, and a dozen others not even worth mentioning.

Right now I work primarily on the front-end, which is to say I write Angular all day long. I'm a dabbler, and I think that's a good thing. I'm prone to tinkering, and I think that's a bad thing.

I don't mind email, so _george_ `dot` _gritsouk_ `at` _gmail_ if in doubt.
