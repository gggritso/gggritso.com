Well,

I'm 24, I work as a web developer and I live in Toronto, Canada. I have a degree in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo.

I’m really into [music](http://www.rdio.com/people/gggritso/), I love movies, I watch TV and I read books. I write, and hate every word of it; [tweeting](http://twitter.com/gggritso) is easier. I play pool pretty well and I'm a mediocre cook but I'm trying.

I’m tidy and precise in all things. I value pragmatism, clarity, character, and personality. I respect discipline, honestly and curiosity. I’m _really_ tall. I don't stress out and  I always do my homework. I don't drink coffee and rarely stay up late. Sometimes I have strong opinions, but the more I learn the harder it gets.

I've written REST APIs, data viz dashboards, metrics collection systems, machine learning projects. I've done QA and helped train new employees. I've assembled chairs and shelves. I've set up cloud servers, written SQL queries. I've done UI work and it was hard. I've worked with MongoDB, Flask, jQuery, mercurial, d3, Postgres, AWS, Snap.svg, Bootstrap, Django, Foundation, git, Ractive.js and a dozen others not even worth mentioning. I'm a dabbler, and I think that's a good thing.

Right now I like Sublime Text (with Vintageous) and iTerm (with Fish shell) on OS X. I'm prone to tinkering, and that's a bad thing.

I don't mind email, so _george_ `dot` _gritsouk_ `at` _gmail_ if in doubt.
