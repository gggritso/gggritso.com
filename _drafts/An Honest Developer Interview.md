# An Honest Developer Interview

Web Developer interviews are disconnected from reality. If you’re still asking questions about sorting algorithms or data structures, it’s probably a good time to stop. Here’s what I think you should do instead:

1. Write up a special ticket for the interview. Attach a short description, a mockup, and a sample API response. Make the description a little vague, make the mockup a little ugly, make the API response too sparse. Warn the candidate that the ticket is not very good, and ask them to skim it, and give their take. Look for:
	- critique and comments on the mockup (symmetry alignment, usability)
	- questions about the description (requirements, expected user behaviour, supported browsers)
	- comments about the API response (missing data, awkward structure)
2. Present the candidate with a sandbox environment for the ticket to be implemented into. Have them talk through a solution and implementation. Evaluate their code and their mockup parity.
3. Ask them to commit the code. Have them write a good commit message or two, ask them to leave a comment on the ticket.
4. Show them a _different_ solution to the problem that you wrote some time ago. This solution should be poor. Have them review the code. Look for:
- comments on the code style
- comments on the mockup parity
