Well,

I'm 25 years old, and I'm a full-stack web developer in Toronto, Canada. I have a degree in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo.

I listen to a ton of [music](http://www.rdio.com/people/gggritso/), I watch and re-watch movies, I like good TV and I do a bad job of reading enough books. I write, and hate every word of it; [tweeting](http://twitter.com/gggritso) is easier. I play pool pretty well and I'm a mediocre cook but I'm learning. Sometimes I [publish code](https://github.com/gggritso/).

I’m tidy and precise in all things. I value pragmatism, clarity, and personality. I respect discipline, honesty, and curiosity. I’m _really_ tall. I never stress out and I always do my homework. I prefer tea to coffee and cider to beer. Sometimes I have strong opinions, but the more I learn the weaker they get. I'm unlearning being snarky.

Over the years I've written REST APIs, data viz dashboards, metrics collection systems, machine learning projects. I've done QA and helped train new employees. I've assembled chairs and shelves. I've set up cloud servers, written SQL queries. I've done UI work and it was hard. I've worked with MongoDB, Flask, jQuery, mercurial, d3, Postgres, AWS, Snap.svg, Bootstrap, Django, Foundation, git, Ractive.js and a dozen others not even worth mentioning. I'm a dabbler, and I think that's a good thing. I'm prone to tinkering, and I think that's a bad thing.

I don't mind email, so _george_ `dot` _gritsouk_ `at` _gmail_ if in doubt.
