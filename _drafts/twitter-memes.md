Twitter is a genre, and it has its own repeated elements. They change over time, of course, but once I notice them, I just can't un-see. These account for probably like 20% of my feed right now. This is the trite bullshit of Twitter.

- a first-world problem sarcastically followed with "send help"
- something-game is too strong

The fewer of these you see in your feed, the better off you are.
