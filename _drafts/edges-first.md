subtitle: Solve all problems for the outliers first

Somehow we've gotten too gung ho about automatic stuff. All processes should be solved to make sure _everyone_ is solved for, and only then can we start thinking about automating the middle.

e.g., domain registration. First, check that all registrations can be done manually. Then, start solving for each case is the automated centre, one by one. Don't leave the edges out.
