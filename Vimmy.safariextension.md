# Vimmy

Vimmy is a simple extension for Safari I wrote to add some vim keybindings. I didn't like the other options mostly because I thought they were ugly and convoluted. The extension is available on the [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.gggritso.vimmy-36948PQEY6). You can report bugs and file suggestions on [GitHub](https://github.com/gggritso/Vimmy.safariextension).

The Safari Extension Gallery likes to act up. If you have any problems with downloading the most recent version, you can download it off my [Amazon S3 server](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gggritso.com/Vimmy.safariextz).
